         <h4> Clearly, SSR was aiming for the Moon, the Sky, the Sun and the Stars – everything that’s out there to conquer, he only wanted to engrave his name on it. And we only wish the actor is now resting peace. While he is gone too soon, he will remain an inspiration for the lesser mortals like us to dream BIG.
